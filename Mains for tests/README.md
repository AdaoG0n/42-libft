This folder contains the main files used for testing the libft library. Each file serves as an entry point to validate the functionality of various components within the library. The tests are designed to ensure compliance with the specifications and to verify that all functions operate as intended.

#### Key Points:
* Purpose: To provide a structured environment for testing the 'libft' implementations.
* Structure: Each main file corresponds to specific functionalities or modules within the library, allowing for isolated testing.

#### Usage:
* When testing, remember to remove the ft_ prefix from the function names used within your test files.<br/>For example, if you are testing ft_substr, you should call strlcpy instead of ft_strlcpy.
* Run these files to execute tests and confirm that the library behaves correctly under various conditions.
